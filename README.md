## Hi there 👋

Welcome to my GitHub!  
I like building things, breaking them, and sometimes fixing them again 😅  

You’ll mostly find random experiments, half-finished ideas, and projects I’m learning from.  
I’m always exploring something new — whether it’s hardware, software, or whatever looks cool that week.

Feel free to look around!  
If something here helps you or makes you smile, that’s a win 🛠️✨

Im currently learning HDL, especially System Verilog
